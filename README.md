# 📚 My ALX Journey into Databases: Discovering Databases for Beginners

Hi there! This is my first deep dive into the world of databases, and I created this project to learn how to design, build, and interact with a MySQL database using Python and SQL. The goal? To build a simple online bookstore database that stores books, authors, customers, and orders.

## 🚀 What This Project Is About

I built a database called `alx_book_store` that includes:
- A table for books 📖
- A table for authors ✍️
- A table for customers 🧍
- A table for orders 🛒
- A table for order details 📦

I used SQL scripts to create and populate these tables, and a Python script to create the database itself.
